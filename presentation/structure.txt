Proposed structure:
===================
* PROBLEM STATEMENT:
  - start with polynomial interpretations for first-order rewriting: this is well-known (one slide)
  - show polynomial interpretations for higher-order rewriting: this is less well-known, but follows similar patterns as the first-order case (one slide)
  - pose the question: can we do something similar if we go one step further up?
    + show an example system with shallow polymorphic rules
    + show some example systems with non-shallow polymorphic rules
    + show how these examples can all be formulated in our PFSs (essentially: a definition by example)
    Here make sure to discuss the application domains.

* METHODOLOGY IDEA:
  - core idea: map all terms to a set A for which there is a well-founded ordering, and prove that rules are included in the ordering
  - observe that for first-order rewriting we can choose (N, >) (but there are other interpretations)
  - observe that for monomorphic higher-order, we can choose weakly monotonic functionals over N (but there are other choices for the base set)
  - propose that for polymorphic rewriting, we actually use a set of system-F like terms
    + show somewhat of how this could look

* METHODOLOGY PART 1: DEFINING THE UNDERLYING SET
  - sketch what our set I looks like;
  - show what \leadsto does (basically beta-reduction) and say that this is essentially functions over N, but in a polymorphic way
    (if you'd take out type abstraction, you would pretty much exactly get the higher-order polynomial interpretations from before)
  - present \succ and \succeq, and say that by coinduction you can show that that's well-defined
  - give an example of something being greater than something else (Example 4.20?)

* METHODOLOGY PART 2: TRANSLATING PFSs
  - show how type mappings work in the fold example
  - show how function symbol mappings work in the same example

* RESULTS
  - show a bunch of calculation rules we can use
  - summarise that fold is easy, just like some other examples
  - briefly show IPC2 and acknowledge that the ext rules are still problematic, but that the rest works
    (moreover, observe that the interpretations were found by basically looking at what would work in a first-order variation, and extending these ideas)
  - note that we have had to do this manually, but that this has given some actionable ideas for automation

* CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
  - summary slide
  - bullet point list for where else we could go with this
